# MulticulturalTV

# Features!

  - Stream YouTube live videos on split screen
  - One main player on the left and six smaller players on the right

You can also:
  - Change those links with ChangeYouTubeLinks.jar
  - Validate YouTube links
  - Stream any embeddable videos

MulticulturalTV is programmed for the TV at [University Liggett School]'s Library Reference Room. Its purpose is to facilitate global education and enable the students to watch international news in different languages.

> Shaping lives that shape lives

### Tech

MulticulturalTV uses a number of open source tools:

* [acm] - Graphics Program
* [Java-Json] - split YouTube links to get the ID
* [Eclipse] - write the Java program

And of course MulticulturalTV itself is open source with a public repository [MulticulturalTV]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

ChangeYouTubeLinks.jar requires [Java Runtime Environment](https://java.com/en/) to run.
Install [Chrome] or another Javascript enabled browser for the best experience.

Open tv.html from the res/ folder to watch the videos.
You can also create a shortcut of tv.html to make it easier.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

MulticulturalTV uses Java and HTML. We are looking for more YouTube channels that legally stream international news 24/7. We would love to hear any advice or complaint from you about this program.
